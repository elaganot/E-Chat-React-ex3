E-chat by eden & ela

This project is a WhatsApp Web clone (but better). we used React to build this website.
we used the react-router library.

To run the project please create a new React app, delete all the files except the node_modules directory,
and download all the files to your directory (that already has the node_modules).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
