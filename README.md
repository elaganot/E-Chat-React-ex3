This project is a WhatsApp Web clone (but better). we used React to build this website.
we used the react-router library.

To run the project please create a new React app, delete all the files except the node_modules directory,
and download all the files to your directory (that already has the node_modules).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

To register press the "here" button in the login page that will take you to the register page,
then just write your details to register, notice that the password must include letters and numbers.
